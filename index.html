				<p>I like digging holes and hiding things inside them<br>
				When I'll grow old I hope I won't forget to find them<br>
				'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
				<p>I built a home and wait for someone to tear it down<br>
				Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running<br>
				'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night</p>
				<p>And a thousand times I've seen this road,<br>
				A thousand times</p>
			</div>
			<div class="refrain">
				(x2)<br>
				I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground<br>
				I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground<br>
				I've got no roots uuuh uuuh uh uh<br>
				I've got no roots
			</div>
			<div class="verse">
				<p>I like standing still, boy that's just a wishful plan<br>
				Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land<br>
				But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night</p>
				<p>I can't get the numbers, and play the guessing game<br>
				It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same<br>
				But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night</p>
				<p>And a thousand times I've seen this road,<br>
				A thousand times</p>
			</div>
			<div class="refrain">
				<p>(x2)<br>
				I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground<br>
				I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground<br>
				I've got no roots uuuh uuuh uh uh<br>
				I've got no roots</p>
